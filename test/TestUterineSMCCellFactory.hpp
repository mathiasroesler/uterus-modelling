 *
 * You can #include any of the files in the project 'src' folder.
 * For example here we #include "Hello.hpp"
 *
 * You can utilise any of the code in the main the Chaste trunk
 * in exactly the same way.
 * NOTE: you will have to alter the project SConscript file lines 41-44
 * to enable #including of code from the 'heart', 'cell_based' or 'crypt'
 * components of Chaste.
